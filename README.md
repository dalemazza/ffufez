# ffufez
ffufez - A simple script to run ffuf for lazy people.

This is a script I wrote to automate the mundane chore of typing in the lengthy ffuf command especially if you have all the arguments set.

This script allows you to input the following:
* Input URL/FUZZ
* Select from the options of wordlists 
   * Currently uses raft and dirbuster wordlists or you scan specify one
* Input your desired extensions or use the (-all) to-do common extensions
* Recursive on or off

This then runs the scan and saves the output to your current directory.
